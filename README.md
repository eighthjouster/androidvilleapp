Androidville Android App

It works in conjunction with Androidville Server.

Good luck to us all.


Pending work notes:
===================

Next up:
 - You should put the server somewhere (linode?)
   - Then update the urls in the app.
 
 - Create the custom view and place arbitrary houses in it.
 
 - Then, get the house information from the API.
 
 - Clickable houses.
 
 - Add a house.
 
 - Deletable a house.
 
 - Edit a house.
 
 - Delete multiple houses.
 
 - Edit multiple houses' positions.
 
 - Edit multiple houses' status.
 
 - Movable map.
 
 - What else?
   - Testing?
